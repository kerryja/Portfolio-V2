              My coding journey began in 2019 when I started attending a 10
              month coding boot camp called Bloc (now called Thinkful). I
              graduated in October and scored my first engineering job a month
              later. This was working for{" "}

              The start of the pandemic, and also the start of working from

              more productive and happier working remotely.

              I am working on a team of 3 frontend devs, where we build the UI
              for Olo's newest product, Olo Pay. This is an end-to-end payment
              solution, providing our brands with payment processing, reporting,
              and fraud prevention. I am currently building out onboarding
              solutions for our customers to sign onto Olo Pay. Most of our
              repos are very modern React apps, keeping me on top of the latest
              advancements. I am also no stranger to working in more mature
              codebases, as I am frequently helping out in some of Olo's oldest
              Ember apps built 10+ years ago.

              The more I work in React, the more I love it. And I am here to
              stay in the frontend world. I love the challenges it brings and
              seeing my work come to life.
